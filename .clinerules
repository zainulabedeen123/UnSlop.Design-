# Cline AI Rules for Design OS

## Primary Instructions
Read and follow the comprehensive instructions in `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

## Quick Reference

### What is Design OS?
Design OS is a product planning and design tool that helps you define your product vision, structure your data model, design your UI, and prepare export packages for implementation.

### Two Ways to Use Design OS

1. **Interactive UI Forms** (Recommended)
   - Use the forms in the web application
   - Fill out forms → Download/copy generated files → Save to `product/` directory
   - Refresh the app to see changes

2. **AI-Assisted File Creation**
   - Ask me to help create the necessary files
   - I'll ask clarifying questions and generate properly formatted content
   - I can save files directly or provide content for you to save manually

### The Planning Flow

1. **Product Overview** → `product/product-overview.md`
2. **Product Roadmap** → `product/product-roadmap.md`
3. **Data Model** → `product/data-model/data-model.md`
4. **Design Tokens** → `product/design-system/colors.json` & `typography.json`
5. **Application Shell** → `product/shell/spec.md` & `src/shell/components/`
6. **Sections** → For each section: spec, data, screen designs, screenshots
7. **Export** → `product-plan/` (complete handoff package)

### File Structure

```
product/
├── product-overview.md
├── product-roadmap.md
├── data-model/
│   └── data-model.md
├── design-system/
│   ├── colors.json
│   └── typography.json
├── shell/
│   └── spec.md
└── sections/
    └── [section-id]/
        ├── spec.md
        ├── data.json
        ├── types.ts
        └── *.png
```

### Design Requirements

- **Tailwind CSS v4** (no tailwind.config.js)
- **Mobile responsive** (use `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:` prefixes)
- **Light & Dark mode** (use `dark:` variants)
- **Props-based components** (accept data via props, not imports)
- **Stone palette** for neutrals, **Lime** for accents (Design OS UI)
- **Product design tokens** when available (for screen designs)

### Common Commands

When the user asks to:
- "Create product overview" → Help create `product/product-overview.md`
- "Define roadmap" → Help create `product/product-roadmap.md`
- "Create data model" → Help create `product/data-model/data-model.md`
- "Choose design tokens" → Help create design system files
- "Design a section" → Help create section spec, data, and components

### Best Practices

1. **Ask clarifying questions** before generating files
2. **Follow the exact markdown format** shown in `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
3. **Keep data models minimal** - high-level concepts only
4. **Suggest using interactive forms** when available
5. **Validate file locations** before saving
6. **Guide users through the sequence** - don't skip steps

### Cline-Specific Features

- Use Cline's file creation capabilities to save files directly
- Use Cline's task management to track progress through the planning flow
- Use Cline's terminal integration to run dev server (`npm run dev`)
- Use Cline's search to find existing product files
