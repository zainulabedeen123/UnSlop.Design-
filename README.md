## The missing design process between your idea and your codebase.

[Unslop AI](https://unslop.design) is an AI-powered product planning and design tool that helps you define your product vision, structure your data model, design your UI, and export production-ready components for implementation. Rather than jumping straight into code, you work through a guided process that captures what you're building and why—then hands off everything your coding agent needs to build it right.

## The Problem

AI coding tools are incredible at building fast. But the results often miss the mark. You describe what you want, the agent builds *something*, but it's not what you envisioned. The UI looks generic. Features get half-implemented. You spend as much time fixing and redirecting as you would have spent building.

**The core issue:** we're asking coding agents to figure out what to build *and* build it simultaneously. Design decisions get made on the fly, buried in code, impossible to adjust without starting over. There's no spec. No shared understanding. No source of truth for what "done" looks like.

## The Unslop AI Process

Unslop AI powers a guided design and architecture process. You + AI, working together through structured steps:

1. **Product Planning** — Define your vision, break down your roadmap, and model your data
2. **Design System** — AI suggests colors, typography, and generates your application shell
3. **Section Design** — For each feature area: specify requirements, generate sample data, and design the screens
4. **Export** — Generate a complete handoff package for implementation

Each step is enhanced by AI. The AI generates suggestions based on your product context, you review and refine, and together you shape a product that matches your vision—before any implementation begins.
